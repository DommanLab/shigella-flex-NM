### Abstract
Shigellosis, a gastrointestinal infection caused by species of Shigella, often presents with bloody diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramping. A large outbreak of Shigella flexneri serotype 2a occurred in Albuquerque, New Mexico (NM) between May 2021 and July 2023 that involved human and non-human primates (NHP) from a local zoo. We included 173 NM isolates identified via routine state public health laboratory surveillance, 15 closely related isolates from other states, and three from non-human primates (NHP). We collected epidemiologic information via interviews and medical record review. Whole genome data was used to determine phylogenetic relationships and predict antimicrobial resistance. The outbreak was initially detected within the men who have sex with men (MSM) population but then predominantly affected people experiencing homelessness (PEH), with PEH accounting for 49% of cases in the outbreak (n=85). Nearly 70% of cases were hospitalized and there was one human death. The outbreak extended into Albuquerque's BioPark Zoo, causing high morbidity and five deaths in NHPs. The NHP isolates were confirmed by genomics to be identical to those in the human outbreak. All isolates were multidrug-resistant, including resistance to fluoroquinolones, a first line treatment option. We demonstrate the transmission of a S. flexneri strain between humans and nonhuman primates, causing fatalities in both. Fluoroquinolone resistance in these isolates led to treatment failures in both populations. This study demonstrates the threat antimicrobial resistant organisms pose to vulnerable human and primate populations and emphasizes the need for vigilant genomic surveillance.
